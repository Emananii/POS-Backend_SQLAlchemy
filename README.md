# POS Backend System

## Overview

View this live link to test the CLI - https://replit.com/@emmanuelwambug1/POS-BackendSQLAlchemy

This project is a command-line interface (CLI) and ORM-powered backend for a Point of Sale (POS) system, developed using Python and SQLAlchemy. It provides a fully structured, persistent backend architecture for managing retail store operations, including inventory control, sales processing, and customer tracking.

Designed as an upgrade from a purely frontend-based prototype, this system transforms earlier in-memory or JSON-based storage into a relational database-backed solution, laying the foundation for future integration with frontend interfaces and RESTful APIs. The project applies modern software engineering practices to ensure maintainability, scalability, and extensibility.

---

## Core Objectives

- Build a fully functional CLI tool to simulate and manage store operations in a terminal environment.
- Use SQLAlchemy to define and operate on at least three interrelated models: `Product`, `Sale`, and `Customer`.
- Establish clean modular architecture, using Python packaging conventions and Pipenv for environment management.
- Achieve persistent data storage using a SQLite database to replace ephemeral storage mechanisms.
- Prepare the backend for potential integration with frontend clients (web, desktop, or mobile) via RESTful interfaces.

## Target Users

This CLI tool is designed for the following types of users:

- **Store Attendants / Cashiers**: Quickly search for products, add items to a cart, and finalize sales.
- **Store Managers**: Track inventory, analyze customer activity, and generate daily or weekly reports.
- **Backend Developers**: Extend the backend logic and integrate with graphical user interfaces or frontend applications.

---

## Key Features

- **Product Catalog Management**: Add, update, and remove products from inventory.
- **Sales Transactions**: Build and process shopping carts, finalize purchases, and record transactions with timestamping.
- **Customer Tracking**: Assign transactions to specific customers for future reference and reporting.
- **Data Persistence**: All records are stored and queried through SQLAlchemy and persist between sessions.
- **Analytics & Reporting**: Retrieve historical sales data, track performance, and analyze inventory movement.

## User Stories

### Product Management

- As a store manager, I want to add new products to the system so that the inventory remains up-to-date.
- As a store attendant, I want to edit product details such as name, price, or stock quantity.
- As a cashier, I want to search for products by name or category to quickly assist customers.
- As a user, I want to browse all available products to understand what is in stock.

### Sales & Cart Operations

- As a cashier, I want to add multiple products to a shopping cart with specified quantities.
- As a cashier, I want to view and update the contents of the cart before finalizing a sale.
- As a cashier, I want to perform a checkout that automatically records the sale and adjusts inventory.
- As a store manager, I want each sale to be accurately associated with the products involved.

### Customer Tracking

- As a cashier, I want to register a customer during a sale with their name and contact info.
- As a manager, I want to associate transactions with specific customers for reporting and analytics.

### Analytics & Reporting

- As a manager, I want to list all sales completed on a given date or week.
- As a business owner, I want to calculate total revenue over a selected date range.
- As a manager, I want to identify the best- and worst-performing products by sales frequency.
- As a user, I want to see all purchases made by a particular customer.

## Planned Extensions (Future Work)

- RESTful API using Flask or FastAPI for frontend integration.
- Role-based authentication system (e.g., Admin vs. Cashier).
- Low stock alerts and automated restocking reminders.
- Support for printing or exporting sales receipts.
- Customer loyalty features with points and purchase history tracking.

## Why This Project Matters

This backend system serves as a foundation for building production-grade applications. It offers practical experience in:

- Relational data modeling and normalization
- Clean separation of business logic and persistence layers
- CLI-based interface development for backend workflows
- Environment setup and dependency management with Pipenv
- Modular code organization and scalable architecture

Additionally, it bridges the gap between Phase 2 frontend projects and future full-stack solutions, enabling smooth expansion into GUI or API-based interfaces.
